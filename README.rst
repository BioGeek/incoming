Incoming
========

Parsing and validating REST API payload is messy. Especially when you want to
have custom validation rules that don't directly map to your ORM restrictions.
Incoming is a small framework to help you validate incoming payload in your
HTTP requests.

Incoming is targeted towards helping validate incoming JSON payload.
